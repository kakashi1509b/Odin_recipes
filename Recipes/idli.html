    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> Idli is a traditional South Indian steamed rice cake made from fermented rice and urad dal (black gram) batter. It is a soft, fluffy, and spongy dish that is typically served for breakfast or as a snack. Idlis are known for their light texture and mild flavor, making them a popular choice for a healthy and nutritious meal. They are often accompanied by various chutneys and sambar, which enhance their taste. Idlis are gluten-free and easy to digest, making them suitable for people of all ages. </p>
    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 cup rice </li>
        <li> 1/2 cup urad dal (black gram) </li>
        <li> 1/4 teaspoon fenugreek seeds </li>
        <li> Salt to taste </li>
        <li> Water as needed </li>
    </ul>   
    <h3> Instructions </h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Rinse the rice and urad dal separately under cold water. Soak them in water for at least 4-6 hours or overnight. </li>
        <li> Drain the soaked rice and urad dal. In a blender or wet grinder, grind the urad dal with a little water until smooth and fluffy. Transfer it to a large bowl. </li>
        <li> Next, grind the rice along with fenugreek seeds, adding water as needed, until you get a smooth batter. Combine the rice batter with the urad dal batter in the large bowl. </li>
        <li> Add salt to the batter and mix well. Cover the bowl and let the batter ferment in a warm place for 8-12 hours or overnight, until it has doubled in size and has a slightly tangy aroma. </li>
        <li> After fermentation, gently stir the batter. If it's too thick, add a little water to achieve a pourable consistency. </li>
        <li> Grease the idli molds with oil or ghee. Pour the batter into the molds, filling them about 3/4 full. </li>
        <li> Steam the idlis in a steamer or idli cooker for 10-15 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. </li>
        <li> Remove the idlis from the molds using a spoon. </li>
        <li> Serve the idlis hot with chutneys and sambar. </li>
    </ol>
