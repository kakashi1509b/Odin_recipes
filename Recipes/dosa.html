    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> Dosa is a popular South Indian dish made from fermented rice and urad dal (black gram) batter. It is a thin, crispy pancake that is typically served with various chutneys and sambar. Dosa is known for its unique texture and tangy flavor, which comes from the fermentation process. It is a versatile dish that can be enjoyed for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, and can be filled with a variety of ingredients such as potatoes, cheese, or vegetables to create different variations like masala dosa or cheese dosa. </p>
    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 cup rice </li>
        <li> 1/2 cup urad dal (black gram) </li>
        <li> 1/4 teaspoon fenugreek seeds </li>
        <li> Salt to taste </li>
        <li> Water as needed </li>
        <li> Oil or ghee for cooking </li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Instructions </h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Rinse the rice and urad dal separately under cold water. Soak them in water for at least 4-6 hours or overnight. </li>
        <li> Drain the soaked rice and urad dal. In a blender or wet grinder, grind the urad dal with a little water until smooth and fluffy. Transfer it to a large bowl. </li>
        <li> Next, grind the rice along with fenugreek seeds, adding water as needed, until you get a smooth batter. Combine the rice batter with the urad dal batter in the large bowl. </li>
        <li> Add salt to the batter and mix well. Cover the bowl and let the batter ferment in a warm place for 8-12 hours or overnight, until it has doubled in size and has a slightly tangy aroma. </li>
        <li> After fermentation, gently stir the batter. If it's too thick, add a little water to achieve a pourable consistency. </li>
        <li> Heat a non-stick skillet or tawa over medium heat. Lightly grease it with oil or ghee. </li>
        <li> Pour a ladleful of batter onto the center of the skillet and spread it out in a circular motion to form a thin pancake. </li>
        <li> Drizzle a little oil or ghee around the edges of the dosa. Cook for 2-3 minutes until the bottom is golden brown and crispy. </li>
        <li> Flip the dosa and cook for another minute on the other side (optional). </li>
        <li> Remove the dosa from the skillet and serve hot with chutneys and sambar. </li>
    </ol>
